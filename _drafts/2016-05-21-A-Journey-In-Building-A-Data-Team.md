When I arrived at Oregon Public Broadcasting a little over two years ago, there were essentially only half a dozen reporters in the whole building.

The idea of a full-fledged data team seemed ludicrous. I was the closest thing to it, and I was a environment beat reporter with decent data analysis chops and programming skills that would be considered good only by reporter standards.

But somehow, it happened. An environmental reporter and a magazine designer made a data team. And in the process, we've learned a lot about what's possible, how to get there, how to derail yourselves, and how to get back on track.

This isn't a how-to guide for starting a data team. Those [already exist from people far more successful at it than me](http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/04/want-to-start-a-small-data-journalism-team-in-your-newsroom-here-are-8-steps/).

This as an example of one effort to bring precision journalism and data storytelling techniques into a virgin newsroom. Here's the story of how we've done it. The process, triumphs, frustrations and sadness. May the details serve you well.

### In the beginning, there was a 3mb html file and a <center> tag.

It started with [this](http://earthfix.info/news/article/seasons-of-smoke-exploring-two-decades-of-wildfire/). A map of wildfire seasons over time, one I'm now embarrassed to look at.

I was two, maybe three weeks on the job when I made an earlier, jankier version of the map you'll see at that link.

### And then there was structure

### We evolved
One of the most important aspects of that Scott Klein guide, and one I've heard from others in the journalism community including the data editor of the incredible project Failure Factories, is to recruit generalists.

Here's how it works for us: We've got two people. We each know what our wheelhouse is, but we've expanded our comfort zone to include a lot. Jason is a visualization expert. He knows design elements forward and backward. He makes things beautiful. His bread and butter now is using D3, HTML and CSS for data visualizations.

But he also cleans data in Excel, analyzes it for stories and makes news bots that track court cases and campaign finance donations.

I'm a reporter at heart. The data work I do is usually to find a story, so I'm usually working in Excel or SQL or using Python to scrape websites, clean data and analyze it for a story. I also know HTML, CSS, enough javascript to be dangerous and best practices for information design.

Both of us routinely take data projects from start to finish on our own.

When we're at our best, Jason handling most of the front-end work of visualizing the data and I'm handling most of the back-end of cleaning and/or analysis. I'd say it's Something like a 80-20 workload split each way. That way we've efficiently divided labor, but neither of us is on an island. We're pitching in on the other person's work, critiquing it and problem solving together.

A [recent project on livestock grazing and environmental health](http://www.opb.org/news/widget/livestock-grazing-rangeland-health/) is an example of this. I obtained the data, cleaned it and analyzed it. Jason designed the page, made stunning maps in QGIS that turned into interactive leaflet maps when you clicked on them, allowing you to explore the data in-depth.

### And then there was buy-in

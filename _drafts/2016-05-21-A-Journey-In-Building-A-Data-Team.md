When I arrived at Oregon Public Broadcasting a little over two years ago, there were essentially only half a dozen reporters in the whole building.

The idea of a full-fledged data team seemed ludicrous. I was the closest thing to it, and I was a beat reporter on the environment team.

But somehow, it happened. An environmental reporter and a magazine designer turned themselves into a makeshift data team.

In in the process, I learned a lot about what's possible, how to get there, how to derail yourself, and how to get back on track.

This is not a how-to guide for starting a data team. If you want that, [check this out](http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/04/want-to-start-a-small-data-journalism-team-in-your-newsroom-here-are-8-steps/) for starters.

This as an example of one effort to bring precision journalism and data storytelling techniques into a virgin newsroom. Here's the story of how we've done it. The process, triumphs, frustrations and sadness. May the details serve you well.

### In the beginning, there was a 3mb html file and a <center> tag.

My first big data visualization on the EarthFix team was [this](http://earthfix.info/news/article/seasons-of-smoke-exploring-two-decades-of-wildfire/) â€” a map of wildfire seasons over time that I'm now embarrassed to look at.

I was two, maybe three weeks on the job when I made an earlier, even jankier version of the map you'll see at that link.

But Jason Bernert took notice. At the time, Jason was designing OPB's iPad magazine and helping out with various other digital efforts like the [beautiful storytelling of the discovery of glacier caves on Mount Hood](http://www.opb.org/glaciercaves/).

As a web designer, he'd been wanting to get into data visualization. So we started talking.

The first thing with both our DNA on it was a project on the [problem of air quality in portable classrooms](http://earthfix.info/portables/index.html). Jason designed a landing page for some data-driven elements I cooked up.

### And then there was buy-in

In 2014, OPB started a major effort to document Oregon's seismic preparedness. It involved nearly everyone in the building. If you didn't know, Oregon is due for a magnitude 8 or 9 earthquake.

From some earlier work I'd done, I knew the state had detailed geospatial models showing what they expected for shaking, tsunami inundation, landslides, etc. I dreamed of an app that let people search their address and find out what a magnitude 9 would look like where they live. For a long time, it existed only as a sketch in my notebook.

Then Jason brought the idea to Hack Oregon, a nonprofit specializing in civic data efforts.


### And then there was structures
One of the most important things I heard from others in the journalism community is to recruit generalists -- people who can and will own a project from start to finish.

Here's how it worked for us: We got people. We each know what our wheelhouse is, but we've expanded our comfort zone to include a lot. Jason is a visualization expert. He knows design elements forward and backward. He makes things beautiful. His bread and butter now is using D3, HTML and CSS for data visualizations.

But he also cleans data in Excel, writes scripts to automate processes and makes Slack bots that track court cases and campaign finance donations.

I'm a reporter at heart. The data work I do is usually to find a story, so I'm usually working in a spreadsheet or using Python to scrape websites, clean data and analyze it for a story. But I've also studied best practices for information design and made myself dangerous with Javascript, HTML and CSS.

Both of us routinely take data projects from start to finish on our own.

When we were at our best, Jason handled most of the front-end work of visualizing the data and I handled the back-end of cleaning and analysis. Something like a 80-20 split each way. We divided labor, but neither of us was on an island. We pitched in on the other's work and fought through problems together.

A [recent project on livestock grazing and environmental health](http://www.opb.org/news/widget/livestock-grazing-rangeland-health/) is an example of this. I obtained the data, cleaned it and analyzed it. Jason designed the page, made stunning maps in QGIS that turned into interactive leaflet maps when you clicked on them, allowing you to explore the data in-depth.

### And then we lost momentum

Most of my recent work can be found [on the EarthFix site](http://www.opb.org/contributor/tony-schick/).  

I use data and practice journalism with attention to methodology. It's been called a lot of things over the years including precision journalism, computer-assisted reporting and data journalism. It also takes many forms. I write Python and Javascript, design web pages, scrape databases and crunch numbers.

Sometimes it means [writing narrative news stories based on my own data analysis](http://www.opb.org/news/series/portland-oregon-air-pollution-glass/neighbors-to-north-portland-polluter-say-deq-ignored-their-complaints/).

I also [help other reporters with data for their stories](http://www.opb.org/news/series/unprepared/unprepared-towns-along-coast-manage-tsunami-risk-in-different-ways/).

Sometimes I make [data visualizations](http://kuow.org/post/landslide-safety-all-over-map-washington).

Or do [research for an infographic](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/03/global-food-waste-statistics/).

Or create [web applications that show you data based on your location](http://www.opb.org/aftershock).

Sometimes it's [a combination of a lot of those](http://www.opb.org/news/article/backlog-grows-for-rangelands/).

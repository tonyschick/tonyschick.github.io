I am not an expert on encyrption tools, spycraft or strategies for online privacy. Nor have I ever had a desperate need for them while working on a story. But it's become a reality that digital communcication through typical channels is not secure, nor private, and that should matter to journalists. The Associated Press had its phone records seized by the Department of Justice. The National Security Agency collects massive amounts of metadata on phone records and online data from major servers that everyone who is connected is connected to. 

[And now, Slate reports](http://www.anthonyschick.com/blog/dispatches/2013/8/14/how-journalists-can-and-need-learn-safe-communicat/%20http:/www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2013/08/14/gmail_security_google_says_users_have_no_legitimate_expectation_of_privacy.html), Google admits its gmail users have "no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties."

 

That's what we all have to deal with, journalists or not. But for journalists, our livelihood is at stake.

 

This means you don't know who else sees an email to a source. Shield laws wouldn't really matter anymore. For most stories, such practices are not necessary nor are they practical. But if and when we need to, journalists must be able to protect our sources. If journalists cannot offer whistleblowers and concerned citizens a safe and secure way to share important information, then we aren't doing our jobs. And given the current state of digital security and surveillance, we're going to have to work a lot harder to do that.

 

[This week's New York Times Magazine](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDEQqQIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F08%2F18%2Fmagazine%2Flaura-poitras-snowden.html%3Fpagewanted%3Dall&ei=C7ILUvOYD8TqyQGQyICQAw&usg=AFQjCNH5_5rmWkIrsvVnsmsmLBsJh2TmQw&sig2=h78l075mlsJ_7a4E-8Ubbw&bvm=bv.50723672,d.aWc) has a detailed piece on documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras, who along with Glen Greenwald of The Guardian helped National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leak thousands of documents about the agency and its digital surveillance programs. 

 

One of the most interesting pieces n the piece for journailsm is a section forwarded to me by a cowowrker. In it, the Times describes Poitras as having as skillset that is"particularly vital — and far from the journalistic norm — in an era of pervasive government spying: she knows, as well as any computer-security expert, how to protect against surveillance." 

 

We mentioned this on the IRE site, as discussion of government surveillance and protecting both journalists and sources have dominated much of the discussion in the IRE community lately -- on listservs, social media and at the IRE Conference.

 
One the IRE blog, we gathered some links and teaching materials to help journalists get acquainted with these tools. Tomorrow, we're rolling out a webinar on Spycraft that covers a lot of these topics and has other great tips.

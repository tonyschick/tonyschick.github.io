I'm a journalist on the EarthFix team at [Oregon Public Broadcasting](http://www.opb.org). Before that I worked for [Investigative Reporters and Editors](http://ire.org), a nonprofit that trains journalists to use investigative and data-mining techniques.

I live in Portland, Ore., with my wife and two dogs.

I've been freelancing in journalism, research and data analysis since 2007. You can reach me at schick.anthony at gmail.

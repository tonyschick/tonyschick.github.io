I'm a journalist on the EarthFix team at [Oregon Public Broadcasting](http://www.opb.org/news/topic/environment/), where I focus on investigative projects and using data to find and tell stories. Before that I worked for [Investigative Reporters and Editors](http://ire.org), a nonprofit that trains journalists to use investigative and data-mining techniques.

I've been freelancing in journalism, research and data analysis since 2007. You can reach me at schick.anthony at gmail.

I also have a [public key](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xE3A41916D23BA9B1).

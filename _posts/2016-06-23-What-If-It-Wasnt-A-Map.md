Just because your data includes a geography doesn't mean it should be a map. There could be better ways to visualize the data.

This is a concept that I've seen in a few articles recently and heard discussed often at conferences like [NICAR](http://ire.org/conferences/nicar2016/).

Here's one example from our newsroom.

For a recent EarthFix story tracking the Northwest's [electronic waste to scrapyards overseas](http://earthfix.info/news/series/circuit/), I was asked to create a map showing the patchwork of state laws regulating the recycling of old electronics, which can contain toxic materials like lead or mercury.

Then we asked: "should it really be a map?"

No, it shouldn't.

The dataset is maintained by the Electronics Recycling Coordination Clearinghouse (ERCC). It shows which state laws cover which products like computers, televisions and printers. It also shows what entities — meaning households, businesses and schools — are covered by the laws.

The ERCC keeps it maps. Here's what they look like. It's hard to figure it out exactly what they show without some further investigation.

The graphic was meant to show how, in the absence of federal law, a patchwork of laws across the country developed that is rife with gaps and inconsistencies. Then it hit us: We could actually make a patchwork.

Rather than a map, we could create a table — more like a bingo card — of what states regulated what. Simple, yet effective. It ran within stories and [on its own](http://www.opb.org/news/widget/the-patchwork-of-e-waste-laws-in-the-united-states/) at on our site.

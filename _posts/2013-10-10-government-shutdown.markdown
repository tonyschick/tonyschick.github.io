The government has shut down. National parks, our greatest treasure, have closed. Census data, sickeningly, is considered "non-essential."

Let IRE light your darkest hour.[1]

That was the joke intro I wrote for a short post on the IRE site, which, sadly, didn't make it into the final version.

But in all seriousness, the fact that .gov sites across the web aren't available is a problem for public information, and particularly for the journalists who use that public data to find and tell important stories. So I started a spreadsheet for IRE in an attempt to keep track of what data are available, what has been closed off and what alternative sources are available. We're crowdsourcing it, so if you know of  a data source we should add to the list, click on this link to the spreadsheet and add it to the list.
